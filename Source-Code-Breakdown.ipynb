    "## Defining the specifications of the vending machine program\n",
    "The vending machine in this project is designed to be a simple simulation of a real-world vending machine with the following characteristics:\n",
    "1. The vending machine requires a system for managing its inventory of products, including the ability to add, remove, and update products.\n",
    "> Our intuition to implement this is through the use of python list or dictionaries to enable modular and flexible management of product data, but this project is under the restriction of using **only the material already taught in our lectures** which does not include neither lists or dictionaries. Therefore in order to implement this feature, we will leverage the use of `string` in python to store the product data in a structured format, and use string manipulation methods to read/write the data of the products in the inventory.\n",
    "2. The vending machine must be able to accept payments in multiple currencies, including IDR and SGD.\n",
    "> This program should handle transactions in both IDR and SGD, and convert between the two currencies as needed. Although real-time conversion between transactions are not supported due to exchange rates that may cause losses everytime a conversion is made - which realistically is not desired in a realistic business sense - **the conversion rate can be set in the source code** to simulate the ever changing exchange rate of currencies in the real world.\n",
    "3. The vending machine must be able to dispense change to customers in the same currency as the payment.\n",
    "> This program should be able to reliably calculate the correct amount of change to dispense to the customer, taking into account the currency used for the transaction. The change calculation should be done using a **greedy algorithm** to minimize the number of banknotes returned to the customer. With the added restriction of a **cash dispense limit of 100 unit for each banknote**, the program should also be able to handle situations where the machine does not have enough banknotes to give the exact change requested by the customer.\n",
    "4. The source code must be well-structured and easy to read, with clear comments and documentation.\n",
    "> Despite the lack of formal programming experience among the team members, we will do our best to structure the code in a logical and easy-to-follow manner, with clear comments and documentation to explain the processes behind the implementation of the code.\n"

    "### At the top of the source code, these global variables can be set by `owners` of the vending machine to customize the product inventory and currency conversion rate of the vending machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using multiple variables to store each data of the products, we implemented a system we call `big_strings`. Such as `PRODUCTS` is a string variable that is designed to behave as a \"list\" of products. So called `owners` of the vending machine can **easily add or remove products in this big string** with these data by following a strict format where each `line` are products where its data is separated by dashes `-`, dots `.`, vertical bars `|`, colons `:`, and asterisks `*` to separate different data fields. The format is as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "PRODUCTS = '''\n",
    "-Name.IDR|SGD:stock******\n",
    "'''\n",
    "```\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- `Name` is the name of the product, which can be any string without the special characters used as separators. Preceded by a dash `-` and followed by a dot `.`\n",
    "- `IDR` is the price of the product in Indonesian Rupiah, which is an integer without any special characters. Followed by a vertical bar `|`\n",
    "- `SGD` is the price of the product in Singapore Dollars but **as their cents** to avoid decimals. Followed by a colon `:`\n",
    "- `stock` is the stock of the product, which is an integer without any special characters. Followed by asterisks `*` as fillers to make the whole line **exactly 25 characters long.**\n",
    "- At the end of each 25 characters-long line, there is a newline character `\\n` to separate each product line. Note that this character is **not displayed** by IDEs or text editors, but it is there.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why 25 characters long?\n",
    "In python, `strings` can be imagined as **chains of individual characters** that are **indexed starting from 0**. So although `PRODUCTS` have lines separated by `\\n` newline characters, it is actually a **one dimensional string** of characters. In order to traverse the one dimensional string, **loops would need to iterate through each character one by one** which would cost performance because this would be slow and inefficient for the designed lengths of these big strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, to maintain efficiency, requires a system to **'jump' to the start of each line directly** without having to loop through each character one by one. We call this `line jumping` and this is achieved by making each line **exactly 25 characters long**, so that the starting index of each line can be precisely calculated and thus creating **a reliable line jumping method.**\n",
    "\n",
    "These big string structures start with a newline character `\\n` at index 0, followed by the first line of product data `-` starting at index 1, and 25 characters later `*` ends at index 25, with a newline character `\\n` at index 26. The second line of product data `-` starts at index 27, and so on. So with newline characters being represented with these two symbols `\\n` but not displayed by IDEs and text editors, you can imagine the `PRODUCTS` big string as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "'''\\n\n",
    "-Name.IDR|SGD:stock******\\n\n",
    "-Name.IDR|SGD:stock******\\n\n",
    "'''\n",
    "```\n",
    "### The 25 characters length, the separators of each data field, and the newline characters are all **crucial** for the program to function correctly. If any of these are not followed, the program may not be able to read the product data correctly, leading to errors or unexpected behavior.\n",
    "#### At least one product must be present in the `PRODUCTS` big string for the program to run correctly, with each data field filled with valid data that can just be **placeholders** and the correct order of separators maintained."

Therefore, to avoid potential pitfalls and ensure the reliability of the change calculation process, we decided to represent SGD banknotes in cents (integers) instead of dollars (decimals).
